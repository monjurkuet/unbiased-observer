# DOCUMENT 2: THE AETHER-SYNAPSE MERGER (2024-2025)

The integration of **Project Synapse** into **Aether Corporation** was overseen by **Director Samuel Oakley**. 
Under Aether's leadership, the Synaptic Bridge evolved into the **'Aether Link'**.

In 2024, **Dr. Elara Thorne** led a splinter group within the company to focus on the **'Ghost-in-the-Shell'** initiative, which aimed at digital consciousness backup. This initiative was secretly supported by **The Gaea Trust**, despite their public ties to Aether. 

A critical event occurred on August 12, 2024: The first successful consciousness transfer was performed on a lab primate at **Aether's HQ in San Francisco**. **Samuel J. Oakley** hailed it as a "victory for humanity." However, **E. Thorne** (Elara) warned about ethical slippage in a leaked memo in November 2024.
