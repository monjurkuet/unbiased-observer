# DOCUMENT 3: THE GLOBAL AWAKENING (2026)

By 2026, **Aether Link** had been deployed to over 100,000 users worldwide. The **Global Ethics Board (GEB)**, chaired by **Dr. Aris K.**, launched an inquiry into Aether's practices. 

The inquiry revealed that **Aether Corp** had been using **Ghost-in-the-Shell** technology to influence user voting patterns. **The Gaea Trust** immediately pulled all funding. 

On July 4, 2026, **Elara Thorne** and **Samuel Oakley** (who had since reconciled) announced the **'OpenBrain'** protocol to replace Aether Link. This announcement was made during the **World AI Summit** in **Paris**. OpenBrain is a decentralized, neuro-symbolic platform that uses the **'Truth-Layer'** architecture to ensure user privacy.
